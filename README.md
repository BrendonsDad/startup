## Elevator Pitch
Remember the excietment you felt when you met and hung out with your best friends while growing up? At FriendGauge, we try to capture that feeling. Unlike other social media platforms that try to keep you on them as long as possible, we focuse on helping people with similar interests meet up. Meet people in your area that have a similar taste in music, sports or anything else you could imagine. Invite people to "hang" and form groups. We focus on finding you new friends, and you get to focus on your **real** social life.

## Key Features:
* Invite to Hang!
    * When you find someone you like, invite them to hang out! Set a date and a place. It's that simple.
* Messaging
    * Back and forth messaging pretty standard for social media platforms
* Interests Page
    * A place where you can add your interests, and find people and groups with similar taste!
* Login Authentication
    * Exactly as it sounds.

## Representing all technologies

* HTML: This is pretty standard and will provide the basic structure and text of my application. My application is meant to connect friends, so HTML will be vital to creating a clear UI and making sure that the App has all the nessisary information. Currently, I am planning on using 4 HTML pages. A login page, a profile page, a connect page (where people can find new friends with similar music taste) and a messaging page. 
* CSS: Obviously, I want my startup to look nice, and that is where CSS will come into play. I will use CSS to make sure that my sections, background, and text are all pleasing to my users. Good CSS implementation will be vital to a positive user experience.
* React: React will as the name suggest, help my application react to the users actions. Obviously since I am not making a personal blog, or informational site, but rather an application, I will be using a fair share of React. I will use react to create a nice login/registration form, submitting pictures, playing songs, and sending messages and invites to other users. 
* Services:
    * Connect page
    * Add friend
    * Join Group
    * Message friend
    * Invite friend
* Third party services:
    * Not too sure on the feasability or legality of this, but I would love to implement a way to share your favorite songs like instagram does.
* Authentication: This part of my program will be handeled by my login/registration form, which will be stored in my database.
* Database Data: I will use this to store information on my users, such as their name, birthday, username, password, and images.
* WebSocket Data: This will be vital to having messages sent to and from users. I don't think I will have a home/browsing page, but if I did, I might need to use websockets for those things.

# Deliverables

## HTML deliverable
For this deliverable, I built all the structure of my application usig HTML
- [X] **HTML pages** - I built the basic structure of all my pages (4 in total) referencing the wireframes I made last week.
- [X] **Links** - Links properly work between each page.
- [X] **Text** - I have display text representing the different groups that can be joined, the about page, and the button to create a new group, as well as headers for each page.
- [X] **DB/Login** - Iput boxes and submit button for login and create an aaccount. Database would be referenced here, and the data base would also reference the friends you have made in the messaging board.
- [X] **Websocket** - Text messaging would be displayed in the messaging board as evidence by the image place holder. Divisions set up to receive this.
- [X] **3rd party** - Button set up to share a song which would use an API such as spotifies.

## CSS deliverable
For this deliverable, I built all the CSS styling of my web application.
- [X] **Header, footer, main content body** - I added a consistent style for the header, footer and main content body to make it look modern and clean
- [X] **Navigation** - There is a simplistic menue at the top of the web application that allows the user to flip through each page. Enhanced look using CSS
- [X] **Responsive to window resizing** - Used media queries, grids, and % based values to ensure that the application fits a variety of screens.
- [X] **Application elements** - Used CSS to build a grid of all the potential groups people can join as well as many buttons to build 
- [X] **Application text content** - Made all the text look better and implemented CSS to have application text appear more in context
- [X] **Application images** - All nescicary images scaled and positioned, and decorated using CSS.
