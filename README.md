## Elevator Pitch
Remember the excietment you felt when you met and hung out with your best friends while growing up? At FriendGauge, we try to capture that feeling. Unlike other social media platforms that try to keep you on them as long as possible, we focuse on helping people with similar interests meet up. Meet people in your area that have a similar taste in music, sports or anything else you could imagine. Invite people to "hang" and form groups. We focus on finding you new friends, and you get to focus on your **real** social life.

## Key Features:
* Invite to Hang!
    * When you find someone you like, invite them to hang out! Set a date and a place. It's that simple.
* Messaging
    * Back and forth messaging pretty standard for social media platforms
* Interests Page
    * A place where you can add your interests, and find people and groups with similar taste!
* Login Authentication
    * Exactly as it sounds.

## Representing all technologies

* HTML: This is pretty standard and will provide the basic structure and text of my application. My application is meant to connect friends, so HTML will be vital to creating a clear UI and making sure that the App has all the nessisary information. Currently, I am planning on using 4 HTML pages. A login page, a profile page, a connect page (where people can find new friends with similar music taste) and a messaging page. 
* CSS: Obviously, I want my startup to look nice, and that is where CSS will come into play. I will use CSS to make sure that my sections, background, and text are all pleasing to my users. Good CSS implementation will be vital to a positive user experience.
* React: React will as the name suggest, help my application react to the users actions. Obviously since I am not making a personal blog, or informational site, but rather an application, I will be using a fair share of React. I will use react to create a nice login/registration form, submitting pictures, playing songs, and sending messages and invites to other users. 
* Services:
    * Connect page
    * Add friend
    * Join Group
    * Message friend
    * Invite friend
* Third party services:
    * Not too sure on the feasability or legality of this, but I would love to implement a way to share your favorite songs like instagram does.
* Authentication: This part of my program will be handeled by my login/registration form, which will be stored in my database.
* Database Data: I will use this to store information on my users, such as their name, birthday, username, password, and images.
* WebSocket Data: This will be vital to having messages sent to and from users. I don't think I will have a home/browsing page, but if I did, I might need to use websockets for those things.
