# Notes
This is where I will put all of my notes for this class.

## My First Notes for the Class
- This was a nice training. I didn't learn anything new, but I did get a good refresher on github and git. I will surely put more notes here in the future.

## Getting Started / Start Up Design
- Your startup demonstrates your mastery of the instruction presented by this course. 
- Needs to Demonstrate the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, calling web services, provideing web services, authentication, storing data persistently, and using web sockets for sending realtime data to and from your server. 

Step one: Create an Elevator pitch.

## Elevator Pitch
- Something to excite buisness people or your friends that sums up your start up
- Should be no more than a paragraph.
- Then, after this pitch, sketch out what the applictaion should look like. 

## Representing all technologies

* HTML: This is pretty standard and will provide the basic structure and text of my application. My application is meant to connect friends, so HTML will be vital to creating a clear UI and making sure that the App has all the nessisary information. Currently, I am planning on using 4 HTML pages. A login page, a profile page, a connect page (where people can find new friends with similar music taste) and a messaging page. 
* CSS: Obviously, I want my startup to look nice, and that is where CSS will come into play. I will use CSS to make sure that my sections, background, and text are all pleasing to my users. Good CSS implementation will be vital to a positive user experience.
* React: React will as the name suggest, help my application react to the users actions. Obviously since I am not making a personal blog, or informational site, but rather an application, I will be using a fair share of React. I will use react to create a nice login/registration form, submitting pictures, playing songs, and sending messages and invites to other users. 
* Services:
    * Connect page
    * Add friend
    * Join Music Group
    * Message friend
* Authentication: This part of my program will be handeled by my login/registration form, which will be stored in my database.
* Database Data: I will use this to store information on my users, such as their name, birthday, username, password, and images.
* WebSocket Data: This will be vital to having messages sent to and from users. I don't think I will have a home/browsing page, but if I did, I might need to use websockets for those things.

## First Assignment
What does my README.md page have to look like?
- include start up specification
- elevator pitch
- key features
- and a description of how you will use each technology and design images

### How this will be graded:
* 10% - Proper use of Markdown in README.md
* 20% - A concise and compelling elevator pitch in your README.md
* 10% - A Description of key features in your README.md
* 30% - Description of how you will use each technology
    * HTML - Basic structural and organizational elements
    * CSS - Styling and animating
    * React - Componentization, routing, and fuctional interactivity.
    * Web service - Endpoints provided by your backend service.
    * Third party service - Endpoint procided by some other service
    * Authentication: Register, login, and logout
    * Database data: Store authentication ad application data.
    * WebSockket data: Realtime inforation pushed from your backend to your frontend.
*30% - One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in your README.md.


## Hyptertext Markup Laguage
