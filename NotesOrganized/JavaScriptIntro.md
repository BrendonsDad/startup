# JavaScript Introduction
- Officially known as ECMA specification
- weakly typed language based upon concepts found in C, Java, and Scheme. 
- By far the most used programming language in the world. 
- It runs on every web browser, and is commonly used as a web server language and for creating serverless junctions. 
- Typically executed usig an interpreter at runtime instead of compiling it into a machine specific binary at build time. 

### Getting Started
Basic example

```js
console.log('Hello' + ' ' + 'world');
// OUTPUT : Hello World
```

you can also write your own functions

```js
function join(a, b) {
    return a + ' ' + b;
}

console.log(join('Hello', 'world'));
// OUTPUT: Hello world

```

code delimiters such as {} and ; are not required but are good practice.
