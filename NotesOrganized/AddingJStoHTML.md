# Adding JavaScript to HTML

You can insert JavaqScript into HTML with one of three ways. 

1. Script blok: Directly including it in the HTML within the content of a <script> element
2. External code: Using the src attribute of the script element to reference an external JavaScript file.
3. Inline event attribute: Putting JavaScript directly inline as part of an event attribute handler.
