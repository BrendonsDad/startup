// Variables are declared using either let or const keyword. let allows you to change the value
// of the variable while const will cause an error if you attempt to change it. 

let x = 1;

const y = 2;

// Originally JavaScript used the keyword var to define variables. This has been deprecated becuase
// it causes hard-to-detect errors in code related to the scope of the variable. You should avoid var
// and always declare your variables with either let or const.



// TYPE

Null - The type of a variable that has not been assigned a value.
Undefined - the type of a variable that has not been defined
